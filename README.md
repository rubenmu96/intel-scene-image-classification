# Intel scene image classifiaction

Using convolutional neural networks to classify images in the Intel scene dataset. 

## TODO
- make resnet34.pth and resnet50.pth, then convert to onnx, check if actually faster inference.
- put on huggingface and run the gradio through some api? (https://www.gradio.app/guides/fastapi-app-with-the-gradio-client)
- picture showing the gradio application
- where dataset is taken from
- run from cmd?
- write documentation
- test running it on gpu
- Would it be possible to add link to image in the gradio app, then run it on the link with image. Maybe add some verification that it is an image?
